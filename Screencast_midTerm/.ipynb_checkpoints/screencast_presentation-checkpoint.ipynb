    "The usage of wind energy as a power source is a familiar idea, and for the most part utilized with windmills. At higher altidtudes, the wind is much stronger and less fluctuating. Airplanes usually take advantage of this when travelling. Structures such as windmills can not be build so tall that they can take advantage of these strong winds, but a kite fastened to the ground with a tether long enough can do exactly that. There are different techniques on how to convert the force working on the kite into electrical power - however, in this project, the power from the kite is meant to pull the boat and reduce fuel consumption, and the pull from the kite can be applied with significantly less loss."

This implies a lot of constraints and thus a large optimization problem with may decision variables. We would also have a problem with smoothness of the trajectory with this solution. As a sufficiently accurate model would result in a very small stepsize, the optimization problem would become very big which in turn would take a lot of computation time for each iteration, which again would not contribute to the desired smooth behavior of the kite.\n",

    "**Single shooting** is easy to implement and with this scheme the only optimization variables becomes the $u_{k}$ works best on problems where the control is very simple. In this project the control input $\\tilde{u}$ affects the orientation of the kite, which then again affects the zenith and the azimuth angle indicating the kite's position, and is not too simple. The approximation of modeling the input as a constant or linear function in each time step is therefore a bad approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also due to the integrator embedding, the single shooting method can be inefficient and result in a longer computation time for each step, and thus slower sampling frequency. This is likely to affect the optimality of the solution.\n",
